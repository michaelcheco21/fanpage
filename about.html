                <h2>Yu-Gi-Oh! was a manga series that was conceived in 1996 by Kazuki Takahashi that follows the
                life of a high-school student named Yugi Mutou who solves conflicts with various games. Eventually, 
                this graphic novel series sprouted out two anime series, known as Yu-Gi-Oh! King of Games and 
                Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters in 1998, only 2 years after the first manga was released. The manga series was
                so successful that it created a franchise which inlcudes several spin-off anime series and manga, and even 
                it's very own trading card game. Despite said success, it isn't exactly one of the hottest topics today.
                When the anime first came out, everyone watched it and played the trading card game in school but that died
                down as the game became more difficult with the addition of rulings and more cards. Players disliked this
                as they just want to have fun and believed that being able to lose a game in a matter of minutes wasn't very 
                appealing. This topic about how "a game that isn't fun isn't a good game" has been debated for several years and
                still is a controversial conflict to this day.</h2>
